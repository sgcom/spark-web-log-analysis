---

The dataset is available from [The Internet Traffic Archive](http://ita.ee.lbl.gov/index.html).

##### Dataset source: http://ita.ee.lbl.gov/html/contrib/Sask-HTTP.html

##### Dataset description:

This trace contains seven monthsâ€™ worth of all HTTP requests to the University of Saskatchewan's WWW server. The University of Saskatchewan is located in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada.

The log contains over **_2,400,000_** lines from **_June to December 1995_** - the early days of the World Wide Web.

#### Log file sample and format:

```

#### Artifacts

 * [UofS_Logs_1_ETL.ipynb](https://github.com/sgcom/spark-web-log-analysis/blob/master/UofS_Logs_1_ETL.ipynb) - IPython notebook. Parses the raw log file and loads it into Parquet data store for further analysis with Spark SQL and Spark dataframes. [Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) is columnar data format, very efficient for analytics.
 * [UofS_Logs_2_Explore.ipynb](https://github.com/sgcom/spark-web-log-analysis/blob/master/UofS_Logs_2_Explore.ipynb) - IPython notebook. Run SparkSQL and dataframes queries to explore the log data.
